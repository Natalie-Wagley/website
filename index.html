                    <p class="paragraph">I grew up in South Dakota and am the youngest of two brothers, one being a twin.  With my family, I enjoy watching sports, going on vacations, playing games, celebrating holidays, and spending time at the lake in the summer doing activities like tubing, skiing, fishing and boating.</p> 
                    
                    <p class="paragraph">My favorite shows are The Bachelor/Bachelorette and Big Brother.  I am a huge fan of reality tv.  Along with those shows, I love watching Minnesota sports, the Vikings and Golden Gophers basketball/football.</p>

                    <ul class="hobbies-list">
                        <li>Working out</li>
                        <li>Cooking and baking</li>

                        <li>Taking my dog on walks</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="paragraph">Working out is something I enjoy doing.  I love to get my day started with a little bit of exercise.  My favorite thing to bake is pie and cookies.  I just made a coconut cream pie for Christmas and it was amazing.  Listening to music is so relaxing and I enjoy pop, rap, and country.  Traveling has always been something I love to do although I haven't been able to go many places due to the pandemic.  So far, my favorite place has been Europe.  Hiking is a fun activity I like to do in the spring and summer.  I love working on puzzles by myself and my family and I also enjoy taking my dog on walks when the weather is nice and warm.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">My interest in design started in high school.  The few multimedia courses, art classes, and a web design course introduced me to the art of design.  It was ultimately the web design course that intrigued me to major in Graphic Design.  Through the courses I have completed so far, my focus leans toward web design and marketing/editorial design but am finding new areas that I am interested in.  My favorite projects to date have dealt with brand identity and editorial design.  Other projects I have done are displayed on my <a href= "https://www.behance.net/nataliewagley1">behance</a> site.</p>
    
                <p id="future" class="paragraph">In this course, I hope to build off of basic knowledge I have of html and css.  Learning new things about design and challenging myself is something I love to do.  Looking into the future, I want to move to a bigger city and work for a company within the field of web and marketing design.  Iâ€™d love to do something with social media marketing or anything pertaining to design but would be grateful for any design opportunity given to me.</p>
